# Change++ 2022 Coding Challenge

## How to run:
To run this program, first clone the code onto your computer using git.

Next, `cd` into the `/server` folder and run `npm install` to install the packages for the backend.

Then, do `cd ../client` and run `npm install` to install the packages for the frontend.

Once all of the packages are installed, go into the the `/server` folder and run `npm start` to begin the backend server. This is hosted on `localhost:5000`.


To launch the React App, go to the `/client` folder and run `npm start`. This should open up the React webapp in your default browser once it boots up. It is hosted on `localhost:3000`.


If the screen goes blank, just reload the page and/or restart the server. Musixmatch has certain singles (ones that were re-released with new features) listed as albums, which causes an error when trying to load a list of songs from the album.

## Reflection on This Challenge
Going from minimal knowledge of HTML and CSS to coding in NodeJS, React, and accessing the Musixmatch API was a massive swing for 1 week. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone as much as possible and that was reflected in my final product because my determination to have a Musixmatch and NodeJS backend meant that I didn't have time to create the sleek frontend that I wanted. That being said, this was a fascinating project for me and I can't wait to spend more time learning about full-stack development in the future.
